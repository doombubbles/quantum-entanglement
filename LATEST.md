- Added Abilities Fix setting that changes other abilities like the Tsar Bomba that don't normally work so that the Wizard Lord Phoenix can make them permanent.
- Added Super Entanglement setting that makes *all* mutators also get applied to linked towers for even more entanglement craziness
- Added Cache Visualizer debug option to see how the linked entities end up being used within the entity factory
